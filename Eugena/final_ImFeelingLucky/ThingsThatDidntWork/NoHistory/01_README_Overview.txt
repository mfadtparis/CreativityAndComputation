This extension was supposed to delete the link of the page you’re currently visiting as you access the site.

So essentially, the history would self-delete itself and theoretically never even be in your history.

But, as I started reading other code projects, etc. I realized that this isn’t the nature of Google Chrome Extension’s “history” function.

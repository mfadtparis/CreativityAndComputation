I wanted to practice overriding page content before creating a Chrome extension that would override images on the New York Times. All images on the front page of the New York Times would have been replaced with the muppets or Sesame street characters to infantilize the news and illustrate some sort of sterility or innocence that can never be achieved in reality.

Using a tutorial written by Codegram, I followed their instructions step-by-step in replacing the images on their staff website with my own random image. After many attempts at trying to figure out which ‘<‘ or syntax errors I had to emend, I didn’t succeed.

There is probably an error my content script.js, but I really don’t think there is an error in my query.min.js document, since I just copy-and-pasted the google API link.

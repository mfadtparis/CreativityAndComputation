I thought that it would be interesting to override webpage background with images, to not only elicit a response from viewers, but to also facilitate viewer awareness of the virtual walls that exist on the Internet, benign and not.

The intention of this extension was to have a random image replace the usual color background of websites. In this folder you will find a “squirt.jpg,” which was used as a test, but if the project had succeeded, the image would have been a picture or GIF of a historical figure (e.g. Dalí) or a satirical GIF. The specificity of the final background image, as described, would highlight the viewer’s awareness of the idea of virtual walls.

I tried several variations of line 10 in the background.js file, including:
- making text transparent
- making the background white (which was foolish because I realized most websites are “white”)
- making the background black (but this only highlighted the text)
- loading an image into the background (which ultimately never appeared, even though the same line of code worked on W3 School’s java prompt)


I also attempted to change the width of the page contents, but as I began practicing with the code, I realized that this project’s concept wasn’t convincing enough to continue.

I wanted to create an extension that was useless because of the content it provided. It was supposed to be a way to have some kind of dialogue about the utility of miscellaneous information.

I began creating an extension to pull an RSS feed from TheDailyMail.co.ukâ€™s celebrity and entertainment gossip columns. 

As I began working through the tutorials on Google Chrome Extension Developer , LifeHacker, and CodeGram, I began to think that creating an RSS extension to a website would be extraneous to most and only useful to those actively interested in celebrity gossip.

So the concept was abandoned.
